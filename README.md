## Fish Market Price Tracker
A real-time web app to help fishermen and vendors log and view fish prices across local markets — improving transparency, boosting profits, and enabling smarter selling decisions.

## Problem Statement
Many local fishermen lack access to real-time price data across nearby markets. This causes them to sell at lower prices, missing better opportunities. There is no lightweight and mobile-friendly system that allows quick price logging and sharing across regions.

## Project Description
Fish Market Price Tracker enables users to:

Submit fish name, market name, and price

Instantly store and retrieve price data using Firebase

View all entries in a simple, transparent list

Share pricing updates with other fishermen or vendors

The app is built to be mobile-friendly, easy to use, and fast.
